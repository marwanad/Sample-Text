# Watchr
Watchr uses the often publicly available Wi-Fi in crowded spaces in order to connect mobile devices to security authorities. Watchr runs in the phone's background and tracks the device's location as well as the nearby sound levels. Watchr uses spikes in ambient noise to identify suspicious activity and determines their coordinates using an adapted algorithm of the inverse square law for sound. The web application displays the coordinates of all devices connected to the wi-fi network and the coordinates of suspiciously loud noises on a map. From the browser, security authorities are able to send alerts such as evacuation directives (route optimized by the device's coordinates) to each connected device.
